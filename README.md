# POCalendar
A (Physical) Oceanography Calendar based on <strike>Airtable</strike> [Notion](https://notion.so).

## Address: [Here](https://www.notion.so/pocalendar/Calendar-for-Physical-Oceanographer-814d0e162904439a932fac0b4ee9b87a)

### Why I create and maintain a public calendar while everyone has his/her own ?

- Event seeking of course. Especially, deadlines are marked on the calendar.
- might be useful to community. Just like another project of mine: [POPapers](https://github.com/chouj/popapers)
- A test whether community is willing to collaborate on such kind of project. 
- convenient to revisit / recall all the events in the past.

### Who might be interested ?

- Researchers in the fields of (Physical) Oceanography and Climate Change.
- Media / Press chasing scientific achievements and academic events.
- Those who cares about or study history of ocean sciences.

### Special Features

- Associated deadlines are marked, not only events.
- - There are "Event list" in which you can sort according to certain `Property` and the "Calendar view" is absolutely instinctive and convenient.
- Events with livestream capability are labeled with different color.

### Notice

- Time zone issue exists. Please pay attention to. Any suggestions about this are appreciated.
- Any adjustment about event time, for example, deadline getting extended, would not be modified/revised accordingly, if I might not be aware of it.

### Seeking collaborators and financial support.

Teamwork and cooperation will make its management a lot easier. However, as defined by Notion, more collaborators, more charges. Thus, please use my [referral link](https://www.notion.so/?r=d94e7c7a384f486185f8296abe5ea15b) to register (You will get $10 credit while I will get $5).

### Changelog

- Moved from [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrc9MSotEPF7zYAv/tbl4cC2OM65kinAka/viwxx55XjBsRGEeIj?blocks=hide&date=2020-04-17&mode=month) to Notion on Mar 11, 2020. [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrc9MSotEPF7zYAv/tbl4cC2OM65kinAka/viwxx55XjBsRGEeIj?blocks=hide&date=2020-04-17&mode=month) is such an elegante tool but simply costs too much for full features.
