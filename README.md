# POCalendar
A (Physical) Oceanography Calendar based on Airtable

## Address: [HTML](https://airtable.com/shrW68CzYP3ez04I8/tbl4cC2OM65kinAka) | [iCal](https://airtable.com/shrW68CzYP3ez04I8/iCal)

### Why I create and maintain a public calendar while everyone has his/her own ?

- Event seeking of course. Especially, deadlines are marked on the calendar.
- might be useful to community. Just like another project of mine: [POPapers](https://github.com/chouj/popapers)
- A test whether community is willing to collaborate on such kind of project. 
- convenient to revisit / recall all the events in the past.

### Who might be interested ?

- Researchers in the fields of (Physical) Oceanography and Climate Change.
- Media / Press chasing scientific achievements and academic events.
- Those who cares about or study history of ocean sciences.

### Special Features

- Associated deadlines are marked, not only events.
- Events can be submitted by everyone via [here](https://airtable.com/shrIHe7ABy8otiAvA).
- Events with livestream capability are labeled with different color.

### Seeking collaborators and financial support.
